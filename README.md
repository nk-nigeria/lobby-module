### Start

The recommended workflow is to use Docker and the compose file to build and run the game server and database resources.

```shell
docker-compose up --build nakama
```

### Recompile / Run

When the containers have been started as shown above you can replace just the game server custom code and recompile it with the `-d` option.

```shell
docker-compose up -d --build nakama
```

### Stop

To stop all running containers you can use the Docker compose sub-command.

```shell
docker-compose down
```

You can wipe the database and workspace with `docker-compose down -v` to remove the disk volumes.
